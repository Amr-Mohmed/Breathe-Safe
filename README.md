# Air Quality Forecasting Project

## Project Overview
This project predicts air quality by leveraging multiple data sources and building a time-series prediction model. The workflow includes data collection, preprocessing, modeling, and deployment via an API.

## Data Sources
The data was collected from three resources:

1. **Real-time TEMPO** â€“ Satellite-based measurements of air pollutants.  
2. **Ground Data (OpenAQ API)** â€“ Sensor-based measurements from multiple locations.  
3. **Weather Data API** â€“ Meteorological parameters influencing air quality.

All collected data was converted to **Excel format** for easier handling and processing.

## Data Processing
- Cleaning and preprocessing of collected datasets.  
- Standardization of units and timestamp alignment.  
- Merging datasets to create a unified dataset ready for modeling.

## Modeling
- Implemented a **Time Series LSTM model** for air quality forecasting.  
- The model was trained on historical data from the combined sources.  

## API Deployment
- Created a **FastAPI endpoint** to serve model predictions.  
- Users can request air quality forecasts by sending parameters to the API.
