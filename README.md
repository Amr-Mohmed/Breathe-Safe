# Breathe-Safe
2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge From EarthData to Action: Cloud Computing with Earth Observation Data for Predicting Cleaner, Safer Skies

Breathe Safe is a modern, open-source web application for real-time air quality monitoring and public health awareness. It leverages NASA TEMPO satellite data, ground-based sensor networks, and weather integration to deliver actionable insights, stakeholder dashboards, and educational resources for individuals, schools, emergency services, and policymakers.


## Project Overview
This project predicts air quality by leveraging multiple data sources and building a time-series prediction model. The workflow includes data collection, preprocessing, modeling, and deployment via an API.

## Data Sources
The data was collected from three resources:
1. **Real-time TEMPO** ‚Äì Satellite-based measurements of air pollutants.  
2. **Ground Data (OpenAQ API)** ‚Äì Sensor-based measurements from multiple locations.  
3. **Weather Data API** ‚Äì Meteorological parameters influencing air quality.

All collected data was converted to **Excel format** for easier handling and processing.

## Data Processing
- Cleaning and preprocessing of collected datasets.  
- Standardization of units and timestamp alignment.  
- Merging datasets to create a unified dataset ready for modeling.

## Modeling
- Implemented a **Time Series LSTM model** for air quality forecasting.  
- The model was trained on historical data from the combined sources.

## API Deployment
- Created a **FastAPI endpoint** to serve model predictions.  
- Users can request air quality forecasts by sending parameters to the API.

## üìå Project Overview

- **Data Input** ‚Üí We send environmental features (Days CO, NO2, Ozone, PM2.5, PM10) to a **FastAPI AI model**.  
- **Prediction** ‚Üí FastAPI returns a predicted AQI (Air Quality Index).  
- **Storage** ‚Üí Prediction is saved using a **generic repository pattern** with EF Core.  
- **Categorization & Alerts** ‚Üí Stakeholders are notified when AQI exceeds thresholds.  

This ensures communities, schools, governments, and health-sensitive groups can **take timely action**.

---

## üèó Architecture

### ‚úÖ Models
- **`Subscriber`** ‚Üí Represents stakeholders (e.g., Schools, ElderCare, Health-Sensitive Groups).  
- **`AirQualityPrediction`** ‚Üí Stores prediction results (AQI, date, advisory).  

- **`AirQualityRequest`** ‚Üí Input request DTO for sending features to FastAPI.  

### ‚úÖ Services
- **`AirQualityPredictionService`**
  - Fetches predictions from FastAPI.  
  - Stores them in DB.  
  - Queries history (today, last week, last month).  
  - Triggers notifications when AQI crosses thresholds.  

- **`SubscriberService`**
  - Manages subscribers.  
  - Sends notifications to specific subscriber groups.  

### ‚úÖ Repository Pattern
A **generic repository** provides CRUD operations for all entities.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Service Logic

### `AirQualityPredictionService`
- **AddAirQualityData** ‚Üí Stores prediction and triggers AQI categorization logic.  
- **GetAirQualityPredictionsAsync** ‚Üí Calls FastAPI with `AirQualityRequest`, receives AQI, saves, and notifies subscribers.  
- **Query Methods**  
  - `GetTodayAirQualityFor(location)`  
  - `GetLastWeekAirQualityFor(location)`  
  - `GetLastMonthAirQualityFor(location)`  

#### AQI Threshold ‚Üí Notification Rules
- **101‚Äì150** ‚Üí Notify ElderCare, Industrial Zone Residents, Health-Sensitive Groups  
- **151‚Äì200** ‚Üí Notify Health-Sensitive Groups  
- **201‚Äì300** ‚Üí Notify Health-Sensitive Groups + Disaster Readiness Orgs  
- **301‚Äì500** ‚Üí Notify all critical stakeholders (Health, Crisis, Meteorological, Govt, Public, etc.)  

---

### `SubscriberService`
- **AddSubscriber** ‚Üí Registers new stakeholder.  
- **Notify** ‚Üí Retrieves subscribers by type and (future) sends alerts (email, SMS, push).
