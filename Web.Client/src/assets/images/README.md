# Image Instructions

To add your generated image to the application:

1. Save your Gemini-generated image as "clean-vs-polluted-air.jpg" 
2. Place it in this directory: `f:\Space\Breathe-Safe\Web.Client\src\assets\images\`
3. The image should be optimized for web (recommended size: 800x600px or similar aspect ratio)

The image path in the code is: `assets/images/clean-vs-polluted-air.jpg`

Your image shows:
- Left side: Clean city with blue skies, green trees, people breathing freely
- Right side: Polluted city with smog, gray skies, people in masks  
- Center: NASA TEMPO satellite monitoring both sides
- Split-screen composition with vibrant blues/greens vs muted grays/oranges
